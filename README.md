# Neon Jekyll Components #
Some Liquid components which can be used in Jekyll, for use in the Neon theme system.



# Dependencies #

This repo only contains renderers for HTML code. As such, it assumes you will be using [the Neon stylesheet system](https://github.com/BlueHuskyStudios/stylesheets) to render these components. This can be utilized simply by importing the following as normal CSS stylesheets:

- **Flex**:           https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/structure/flex.css
- **Neon Tables**:    https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-tables.css
- **Neon Renderer**:  https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-renderer.css

- A Neon theme stylesheet, such as these:
    - **Neon Water**: https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-water.css
    - **Neon Earth**: https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-earth.css
    - **Neon Fire**:  https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-fire.css
    - **Neon Air**:   https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/neon/neon-air.css

- **Material Icons**: https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons


Additionally, these are recommended:

- **Print**: https://Stylesheets.BHStudios.org/assets/v2/basics/print.css
- **Some Google fonts:** https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,100i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,700|Questrial|ZCOOL+QingKe+HuangYou|Oswald:600&amp;subset=chinese-simplified,korean,latin-ext,vietnamese,cyrillic,cyrillic-ext,greek,greek-ext



Of course, if you prefer, you can use any stylesheet you want, including making your own.



# Components #

This repo contains the following components, usable as Jekyll/Liquid includes. The documentation below uses some symbols to help it remain compact:

- 👇🏽 - The argument can be placed directly in the include's arguments
- 📄 - The argument can be specified in the page's front-matter
- 🌐 - The argument can be specified in the site's config

This is also the precedence order: The top items in this list take precedence over following ones. If two or more are specified, the highest one is used.



## App Bar ##
`App-Bar/app-bar.html`
The app bar is modeled after [the Material app bar (Top)](https://material.io/components/app-bars-top).


### Arguments ###

<table>
<thead><tr><th> Argument </th><th> Description </th><th> Allowed values </th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
    <td> 👇🏽📄 `title` </td><td> The text shown in the app bar as the page title </td>
    <td>

- Any string: The given string is blindly placed in the app bar

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> _optional_ <hr/> 👇🏽📄 `navigation-back` </td><td>Whether to provide a "Back" button in the app bar. This can be specified in the page front matter, or as an include argument. If both are specified, the include argument take precedence. </td>
    <td>

- Excluded or `false`: A "Sidebar" button appears instead
- `true`:              A back button appears in place of the sidebar button, using JavaScript
                       to navigate back. If JavaScript is disabled, this navigates to the site
                       root ("`/`")
- Any string:          A back button appears which navigates to the given string, blindly
                       placing it in the `href` field.

    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td> _optional_ <hr/> 👇🏽📄 `subtitle` </td><td>A subtitle to show in the app bar </td>
    <td>

- Excluded or `false`: No subtitle appears
- Any string:          The given string is blindly placed in the app bar next to the title

    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



## Sidebar ##
`Sidebar/sidebar.html`
The sidebar is modeled after [the Material navigation Drawer](https://material.io/components/navigation-drawer)

All site config variants to these must be nested under a `sidebar` YML object, like this:

```yml
sidebar:
    headerImage:
        url: https://example.com/sidebar-header.png
        htmlClassNames: "greyscale square"
```
